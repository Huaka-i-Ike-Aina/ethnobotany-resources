<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ethnobotany-resources is to collect datasets, field notes, and literature
references for plants used in traditional medicine and cultural
practices.

## Ethnobotanical Databases

We maintain a curated list of Pacific Islander foodways resources in `data/ethnobotanical_databases.csv`. 

You can load them in R with:

databases <- readr::read_csv("data/ethnobotanical_databases.csv")
