Ka‘ahumanu was at that time striving to abolish the kapu system. [III] Hawai‘i palu la‘i. Ti-leaf lickers of Hawai‘i. This saying originated after Kamehameha conquered the island of O‘ahu. The people of Kailua, O‘ahu, gave a great feast for him, not expecting him to bring such a crowd of people. The first to arive ate up the meat, so the second group had to be content with licking and nibbling at the bits of meat that adhered to the ti leaves.

The pool of ‘Eleile on Maui is famed in songs and chants. Visitors throw ti stalks into the pool and watch the water carry them all around before washing them downstream. [VI] Lau‘i pekepeke. Short-leaved ti plant. An insult applied to the kauwa. Like small-leaved ti, they weren't much use. Longer leaves were better liked because they were useful as food wrappers. [VII] Palaki a Moemoe. Ti daubs of Moemoe. Excrement. Ti eaten in great quantity loosens the bowels. Moemoe was a prophet whose excrement, when questioned, was said to reply of his whereabouts.

The god, who also had a wind form, bore the mana along, and when it touched the one desired he or she became very much in love with the sender.
